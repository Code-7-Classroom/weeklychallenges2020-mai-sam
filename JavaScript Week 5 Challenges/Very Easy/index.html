        VERY EASY: What is the difference between the following JavaScript keywords: var, let and const. Please provide a written explanation. 
        You are able to include a code reference along with your written explanation for each keyword.
    </h1>

    <p>
      1. The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for
      storing information. 
      
      Example: 
      var = variable 
      
      2. The difference btween var and
      let is that instead of being function scoped, let is block scoped, which
      means that a variable with the let keyowrd is always inside a nested
      block.

      Example: 
      function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
        let discounted = []
      
        for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
          let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
          let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
          discounted.push(finalPrice)
        }

      3. Const is almost the exact same as let however the difference is that
      the value that you assign to const cannot be changed. 

      Example: 
      const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
      car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};    // ERROR
